All directories within this folder contain one question
from metaculus. The format of all folders will be:
README.md
-> this document will contain the question, any sources that 
   I consulted while answering the question, and my thought
   process behind solving the problem

python files/jupyter notebooks
-> These will be the actual code I use to analyze the data I
   find or pull.

And any datasets I can upload I will.
