# Metaculus Forecasting Portfolio

This repository contains my independent forecasting work on Metaculus.

## Approach
- Base-rate–first reasoning
- Explicit assumptions
- Bayesian updating where applicable
- Clear separation of signal vs noise

## Tools
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Jupyter notebooks
- Public datasets

## Repository Structure
- `questions/`: Individual Metaculus questions
- `utils/`: Reusable analysis tools
- `docs/`: Methodology notes

## Notes
This repository is intended as a transparent record of reasoning, not hindsight-optimized results.
